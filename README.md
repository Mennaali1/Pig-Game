# üé≤ Pig Game 

A simple two-player dice game built with  JavaScript. Players take turns rolling a dice and accumulating points. The goal is to reach or exceed a total score of 100 to win the game. Rolling a 1 switches the turn to the other player, and players can choose to hold their current score to add it to their total score.
